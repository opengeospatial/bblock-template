## Prefixes will be used for all RDF Turtle resources so that they can be omitted from the actual snippets
# prefixes:

## List of examples
examples:
  - title: GeoJSON - specialisation example.

    ## Markdown content that will be shown for the example.
    content:
      This examples shows how to define a customised schema based on an existing building block 
      - in this case the *OGC API Features* basic GeoJSON Feature response

    ## Base URI for semantic uplift
    base-uri: http://example.com/features/

    ## The example can define its own prefixes, that will be merged with the global ones
    # prefixes:
    #   ex: http://example.com/

    ## List of code snippets for this example
    snippets:
      - language: json
        # Reference to file
        ref: examples/feature.json
      - language: yaml
        # Inline content
        content: |
          id: 16
          type: Feature
          geometry: null
          properties:
            my-prop: my-value
        ## A snippet can also have its own base-uri, overriding that of the example
        # base-uri: http://example.com/features-2/

        ## A different schema (or fragment thereof) can be used for validating this example.
        ## This is especially useful for examples that only showcase a part of the whole schema
        # schema-ref: '#/$defs/single-definition'

        ## An RDF document that will be used as a closure (additional data) that will be added to the example
        ## RDF when performing SHACL validation.
        # shacl-closure: my-data.ttl
