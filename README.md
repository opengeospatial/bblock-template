# OGC Building Block template

This template provides a working example of an [OGC Building Block](https:blocks.ogc.org). For more info see [the Documentation](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/).

This template is a working automation recipe to define, test and document a set of Building Blocks.

The automation-generated documentation for this example is here: [https://opengeospatial.github.io/bblock-template/](https://opengeospatial.github.io/bblock-template/)

[Examples of using this with typical applications of OGC standards](https://github.com/ogcincubator/bblocks-examples)

Please replace the contents of this README with information about your Building Block(s).
